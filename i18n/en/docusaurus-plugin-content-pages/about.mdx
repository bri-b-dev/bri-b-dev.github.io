# 👩‍💻 About me

I am a **Cloud & Data Platform Engineer** specializing in **backend development (Java/Kotlin, Spring Boot)** and building modern **cloud and data platforms**.  
In my role as a solutions architect, I combine the **analysis of technical requirements** with the **design of scalable, secure, and cost-effective architectures**.  

My experience includes:

- 💻 Design and development of **microservices in Java/Kotlin (Spring Boot)** using an API-first approach  
- 🐍 Building **ETL pipelines in Python** for data-driven scenarios
- ☸️ **Automating deployments in Kubernetes** (AKS & Open Telekom Cloud)
- 🛠️ **Infrastructure as code with Terraform**  
- 🔄 **CI/CD and GitOps processes** with Azure DevOps, FluxCD, and Argo Workflows
- 🔐 Focus on **security, compliance, and quality assurance**

I pay particular attention to **code quality and knowledge transfer**—e.g., through pair programming, code reviews, and mentoring.

# 🌍 Personal life & motivation

I firmly believe that **technology is successful when it empowers people to work creatively and productively**.  

Outside of work, I find balance in **playing golf**, where I am fascinated by the combination of technique, precision, and continuous learning.  
I also enjoy traveling, especially to **Scandinavia**, and discovering new places and cultures.
