Workload Identity in **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** promises fewer secrets, native AzureAD integration, and a replacement for the old AAD Pod Identity.  
In practice, my projects in late 2024 brought not only smooth deployments but also some unexpected pitfalls.  
Here are my **hands-on experiences** ‚Äì structured into Setup, Pitfalls, and Best Practices.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

- **Cluster**: AKS with **Workload Identity feature** enabled  
- **Operator**: `azure-workload-identity` Admission Webhook in the cluster  
- **Service Accounts**: per pod with annotations like  
  ```yaml
  annotations:
    azure.workload.identity/client-id: <client-id>
  ```

* **Azure side**:

  * Managed Identities for pods
  * Role assignments via AAD & Azure RBAC (Storage, Key Vault, Application Gateway)

---

## üöß Pitfalls

### Sidecar injection not always reliable

The annotation `azure.workload.identity/inject-proxy-sidecar` didn't consistently work across operator versions.
Sometimes special Helm templates or additional MutatingWebhook config were required.

### AuthorizationPermissionMismatch

A frequent error when accessing Storage Accounts.
Root cause: mixing up **Management Plane** and **Data Plane** roles.
‚û°Ô∏è Only proper Data Plane roles allow access.

### Helm templates & securityContext

An incorrect `securityContext` in the Helm chart blocked sidecar injection.
Debugging this took time ‚Äì webhook pod logs revealed the root cause.

### Operator versions with breaking changes

Minor operator releases sometimes changed behavior.
‚û°Ô∏è Always check release notes before upgrading.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* **Start small**: test with a single pod + storage account
* **Separate RBAC**: clearly distinguish management vs. data plane roles
* **Check operator logs**: Admission webhook is the first stop for debugging
* **Validate Helm templates**: ensure annotations and sidecars land in pod manifests
* **Plan time**: expect iterations during rollout

<Admonition type="tip" title="My Tip">
Workload Identity saves effort and increases security in the long run.  
But allow **extra iterations** during introduction ‚Äì especially with complex Helm charts.
</Admonition>

## üìå Conclusion

Workload Identity is a **key step for security and cloud-native architectures**.
The initial rollout was not frictionless, but today our platform components run stable and secret-free.
It's worth it ‚Äì even if debugging took more effort than the docs suggested.
