# ⛳ HandyCap  
*See your handicap instantly – no more waiting until the next day.*

## 🤔 Why HandyCap?
With the introduction of the **World Handicap Index (WHI)**, it often takes until the **next day** before your new handicap is officially calculated.  
The quick "beer mat calculation" after a round is a thing of the past.  

:::danger[The Problem]
Golfers no longer know **right after the round** how their score affects their handicap.  
That slows down motivation and makes it harder to reflect on performance immediately.
